(The illumos port of Linux KVM)\n\n\n\n\nVirtual machines provide a PC emulation layer in which you install OpenIndiana just as you would on physical 'bare metal' hardware.\n\n\nVagrant\n\n\nVagrant provides an excellent way to explore OpenIndiana as it fully automates the process of bringing a virtual machine online.\nOpenIndiana comes with an official \nVagrant\n box, which can be used for exploring OpenIndiana before installing it.\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\nAt this time, the OpenIndiana Vagrant box is only available in the form of a text based console.\nAdditionally, Virtualbox is the only currently supported Vagrant provider.\nIn the future the OpenIndiana project hopes to provide additional Vagrant box options.\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\nVagrant is officially available for Mac OS X, Windows and Linux.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDownload and install the latest version of Vagrant for your platform from the \nofficial download page\n.\n\n\nDownload and install the latest version of Virtualbox for your platform from the \nofficial download page\n.\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\n\nOlder versions of Vagrant (as packaged by many LTS Linux distributions), may not support downloading the Vagrant box instance.\nTo work around this limitation, be sure to remove any previously installed instances of Vagrant and obtain the latest Vagrant software directly from the Vagrant website.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRun the following command to download and boot the OpenIndiana vagrant box:\n\n\n\n\nmkdir ~/openindiana_test\ncd ~/openindiana_test\nvagrant init openindiana/hipster\nvagrant up --provider virtualbox\n\n\n\n\nThis will create a file titled \nVagrantfile\n under the ~/openindiana_test directory.\nThe Vagrant box will also be booted.\n\n\n\n\nOnce, the Vagrant box virtual machine is online, connect to it using the following command:\n\n\n\n\nvagrant ssh\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo destroy the OpenIndiana Vagrant instance, issue the following command:\n\n\n\n\nvagrant destroy\n\n\n\n\nPreparation for installing OpenIndiana\n\n\nPrior to installing OpenIndiana:\n\n\n\n\nEnsure your system meets the recommended hardware requirements.\n\n\nEnsure to consult the HCL.\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\n\nInstalling OpenIndiana on unsupported hardware may cause excessive CPU usage, instability, or other problems.\n\n\nPlease be sure to consult the hardware compatibility list (HCL):\n\n\n\n\nIllumos HLC\n\n\nOpenIndiana HCL - components\n\n\nOpenIndiana HCL - systems\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBacking up data\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\n\nBefore attempting to install OpenIndiana, first ensure you backup any important data.\nDo not save the data on another partition or on another disk within the same system.\nInstead save the data to an external device such as a USB hard drive, or external system (network backup service, or a networked system).\nAlways verify your backed up data.\n\n\n\n\n\nDeciding where to install OpenIndiana\n\n\nBy default the OpenIndiana installer creates an EFI partition using a GPT partition table.\nUsing this option, OpenIndiana will use the entire disk.\nNo other operating system can share the same disk.\n\n\nOptionally you may use a legacy MBR partition.\nMBR partitions will allow you to create multiple partitions.\nMBR will also support dual booting another operating system.\n\n\nAnother option is to install to a virtual machine.\n\n\nGathering network information\n\n\nIf your network uses a DHCP server, OpenIndiana can be configured to automatically obtain it's network information.\nIf a DHCP server is not available, then you will need to manually configure your network settings.\n\n\nObtain the following information:\n\n\n\n\nIP address\n\n\nSubnet mask\n\n\nGateway\n\n\nNetwork domain name\n\n\nNetwork DNS servers\n\n\n\n\nDownloading the software\n\n\n\n\n\nPrimary download mirror (London, England):\n\n\n\n\nCD/DVD (ISO) and USB Images\n\n\nTorrents\n\n\n\n\nAlternate mirrors (Asia, Europe, and North America)\n\n\n\n\nhttps://wiki.openindiana.org/oi/Mirrors\n\n\n\n\nIf you wish to purchase a ready made DVD or USB drive there is also \nOSDISC.COM\n.\n\n\nDownload example:\n\n\nwget \nhttp://dlc.openindiana.org/isos/hipster/OI-hipster-gui-20160421.iso\n\nwget \nhttp://dlc.openindiana.org/isos/hipster/OI-hipster-gui-20160421.iso.sha256sum\n\n\n\n\n\nChecking the MD5/SHA\n\n\nChecksum verification example:\n\n\nsha256sum --check OI-hipster-gui-20160421.iso.sha256sum\nOI-hipster-gui-20160421.iso: OK\n\n\n\n\nCreating a bootable OpenIndiana DVD\n\n\nBSD/illumos/Solaris\n\n\nUNIX Console\n \n\n\nThe command to use for writing a CD or DVD is \ncdrecord\n.\nThe syntax of the command is: \ncdrecord dev=device imagefile.iso\n\n\nExamples:\n\n\n\n\ncdrecord dev=/dev/rdsk/c4t1d0p0 imagefile.iso\n\n\ncdrecord dev=4,1,0 imagefile.iso\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\nIf you are re-using a DVD-RW, be sure to blank it first.\n\n\nFor example: \ncdrecord dev=/dev/rdsk/c4t1d0p0 blank=fast\n\n\nWarning: Blanking the disk will destroy all data on the disk.\n\n\n\n\n\nLocating your DVD or CD writing device:\n\n\n\n\nFor BSD, use \ncdrecord -scanbus\n to locate your device.\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\ncdrecord -scanbus\n\n\nCdrecord-ProDVD-ProBD-Clone 3.00 (i386-pc-solaris2.11) Copyright (C) 1995-2010 J\ufffdrg Schilling\nWarning: Using USCSI interface.\nUsing libscg version 'schily-0.9'.\nscsibus4:\n        4,0,0   400) 'ATA     ' 'HITACHI HTS72321' 'C50B' Disk\n        4,1,0   401) 'HL-DT-ST' 'DVDRAM GSA-U20N ' 'HX12' Removable CD-ROM\n        4,2,0   402) *\n        4,3,0   403) *\n        4,4,0   404) *\n        4,5,0   405) *\n        4,6,0   406) *\n        4,7,0   407) *\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\nWhen using \ncdrecord -scanbus\n to determine the device name, specify the device using the SCSI bus ID.\n\n\nFor example: \ncdrecord dev=4,1,0 imagefile.iso\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor illumos/Solaris, you may use either \ncdrecord -scanbus\n or \nrmformat -l\n to locate your device.\n\n\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nrmformat -l\n\n\nLooking for devices...\n     1.

For the selected disk, all existing partitions and any data which they may contain, will be overwritten with the OpenIndiana operating system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPartition the disk\n\n\nWhen the \nPartition the disk\n option is selected, the bottom portion of this panel displays the disk partitioning layout. Prior to selecting this option, please be sure to review all the informational notes and warnings concerning the use of the partitioning option.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you choose to partition the disk, you have additional options as shown above.\nPlease take some time to read the additional guidance provided below.\nWhen you have revised the partitioning as needed, click the \nNext\n button to continue.\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nRegardless of the partitioning option chosen for the installation, manual control of the OpenIndiana file system layout is not supported.\nDuring the installation, the Solaris fdisk partition is reformatted with a default ZFS file system layout.\nAll existing file systems on the Solaris partition are destroyed.\nThe installation uses a Solaris fdisk partition to create a ZFS storage pool.\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nIf you choose to partition the disk, review the following partitioning guidelines, then revise the partitioning panel settings as needed.\n\n\n\n\nOnly one Solaris partition is allowed.\nIf an existing Solaris partition is available, that Solaris partition will be the target for the installation.\nOr, if you do not have an existing Solaris partition, you can change any existing partition to a Solaris partition.\n\n\nYou can resize existing partitions, delete partitions, and create new partitions in this panel.\nFor this option, one existing Solaris partition must be available as the target for the installation.\n\n\nIf you used a third-party partitioning tool such as GParted, then the Disk panel displays a partition named Linux-swap on which you can install OpenIndiana.\n\n\nIn this panel, use the drop-down list for the Linux-swap partition name to change the partition name to Solaris.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\nIf the existing partition table cannot be read, a warning is displayed, and the panel displays proposed partitioning.\nIn this case, all data on the selected disk is destroyed.\n\n\nIf the table can be read, then the following information applies:\n\n\n\n\nThe partitions are displayed in physically sequential order as they are laid out on the disk.\n\n\nResizing a Solaris partition destroys the data on that partition and all physically subsequent partitions.\n\n\nExisting data is not moved to conform to a new partition layout.\n\n\nHowever, resizing the last partition or appending a new partition does not affect the data that already exists in other partitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNon-Solaris partitions cannot be resized.\n\n\nTo make additional space available, you can change an existing partition to Unused.\n\n\nHowever, if you change an existing partition to Unused, all subsequent non-Solaris partitions are also changed to Unused.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNew partitions can only use the available space that follows the last defined partition.\n\n\nThe installer cannot utilize unallocated chunks of space between existing defined partitions.\n\n\nUse the fdisk(1M) command to create new partitions that use the free space between exiting partitions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis screen enables you to type the correct time zone, date, and time for the system to be installed.\nThe top half of the panel displays a world map with major cities marked.\nThe bottom half of the panel provides drop-down selections.\nYou can choose the time zone either from the map or from the drop-down list.\n\n\n\n\nIf you select the time zone from the map, click on a city or click anywhere on the map.\n\n\n\n\nIf you click on the map, but not on a city, the map automatically magnifies that area.\nYou can click on a location within that magnified area.\nYou can drag the cursor to move the magnified area to a different location on the map.\nWhen you select a site on the map, the drop-down selections automatically populate with the time zone, date, and current time for that map selection.\nYou can right-click to undo magnification.\n\n\n\n\nInstead of using the map, you can make your selections in the drop-down fields.\n\n\n\n\nSelect your region, then select Location. Finally, select time zone.\nThe options for each drop-down field are determined by the selection made in the prior drop-down field.\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nAfter making your selections, you may also edit the default date and time that is provided.\n\n\n\nWhen the settings are correct, click Next to continue.\n\n\n\n\nThis screen enables you to select a language and locale.\nThese selections determine the language support, the default date and time, and other data formats for the installed system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can accept the default language selection or change the selection.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA language selection is required.\nYou can select \u201cno default language support.\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe language chosen automatically determines the available locales in the drop-down list.\nOnly one locale can be selected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nAny time that you log in to the installed system, you can change either the locale for that particular session or the default locale by using the Options button in the Login dialog box.\n\n\n\n\n\nReview the following guidelines:\n\n\n\n\nRoot login is not enabled either on the Live CD or on the installed system.\nYou must log in as the user that you create in this panel.\nAfter you log in, you can then become root to configure the system.\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nIf you do not create a user account in this panel, root is set up as a normal account on the installed system, instead of as a role.\nThis is the only situation where you can log in to the installed system as root.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoth the root password and user account are optional.\nHowever, for better security, do complete these fields.\nIf the root password is not defined, a reminder is displayed when you click Next.\nIf you do not want to define a root password, you can proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA user account requires only a Login name for the account to be valid.\nFor better security, however, do complete all fields.\nIf the user account information is not valid, a reminder is displayed when you click Next.\nIf you do not want to define a user account, you can proceed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType a computer name or accept the default.\nThe computer name field cannot be blank.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis screen summarizes the configuration options which will be used to perform the installation.\nBe sure to take the time to review this summary.\nIf a configuration option needs to be changed, you may do so by clicking the \nBack\n button.\nIf the installation options are acceptable, click the \nInstall\n button to begin the installation.\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\nOnce you have clicked the \nInstall\n button, the option to \nQuit\n the installation is no longer available.\nDo not attempt to interrupt an installation already in progress or the system will be left in an inconsistent state.\n\n\n\n\n\nDuring the installation, a progress bar is displayed.\nThe time required to complete the installation is dependent on your hardware.\n\n\n\n\nThe final screen displays completion messages.\nFrom within this panel you may review the installation log.\nTo view the installation log, click the link titled \nOpenIndiana Installation Log\n.\nThe installation log will open in a new window.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the slider located on the right side of the log viewer window, you may scroll up and down to view the entire log file.\nAfter reviewing the log, you may exit the log viewer by clicking the \nClose\n button.\n\n\nCongratulations!\n\nYou have completed the installation of the OpenIndiana Hipster operating

System (IPS)\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nThe image packaging system is delivered as part of the OpenIndiana userland.\nAs such, the pkg related man pages are not available on the illumos.org website.\nThese pages are only available by running the man page viewer locally on your system.\n\n\n\n \nDOC TEAM NOTE:\n\n\n\n\nHave a look at: \npgk cheat sheet\n to see whether there is anything there which we might want to import and validate.\n\n\n\n\n\nIntroduction\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter an initial installation of the OpenIndiana Hipster operating system, you will find many of the software applications you use on a regular basis are not immediately available to you.\nThese software applications are available as packages in a remote Image Packaging System (IPS) repository for downloading and installing over the Internet.\n\n\nWritten in Python, IPS is a network-centric packaging system which enables users to connect to a remote repository for the purpose of downloading and installing packages.\nOpenIndiana Hipster uses IPS for its packaging system.\n\n\nBesides installing packages from a repository, users can also perform the following tasks:\n\n\n\n\nCreate and publish their own IPS packages\n\n\nSet up an OpenIndiana Hipster repository\n\n\nMirror an existing repository\n\n\nPublish existing packages to a repository\n\n\n\n\nOnce you have installed packages, IPS enables you to search, update, and manage those packages on your system.\n\n\nWith IPS , you can upgrade your system to a newer build of OpenIndiana Hipster, install and update your software to the latest available versions, and retrieve packages from mirror repositories.\n\n\nIf the system on which IPS is installed is located on a network, IPS can automatically access the OpenIndiana Hipster package repository.\nFor OpenIndiana Hipster, your IPS client can access the packages from \nhttps://pkg.openindiana.org/hipster\n.\n\n\nIPS packages\n\n\nAn IPS package is defined as a collection of files, directories, links, drivers and dependencies in a defined format.\n\n\nNote the following points about IPS packages:\n\n\n\n\nAn IPS package consists of a set of actions.\nActions are defined when an IPS package is created.\nActions are used for defining the files and directories of the package, setting package attributes, declaring dependencies on other packages, creating users and groups, and installing device drivers.\nSome actions may optionally have tags that provide meta information about the action such as locale information and debug configuration.\n\n\nIPS packages can only be installed from an IPS repository.\n\n\nIPS package repositories can be local to the system or on a remote networked system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIPS commands\n\n\nThe Image Packaging System software provides the following commands:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg\n1\n\n\nUse the \npkg\n1\n command to create an image, to install packages to your image, and to manage packages on your image.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkgsend\n1\n\n\nUse the \npkgsend\n1\n command to publish packages from your image to an existing repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg.depotd\n1M\n\n\nUse the \npkg.depotd\n1M\n command to create and manage your own network repository or set up a mirror repositories.\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkgrecv\n\n\nUse the \npkgrecv\n command to download the contents of a package from a server. The user can then modify the contents by adding additional package attributes and republish the package with the \npkgsend\n command.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \npkg\n5\n man page describes the overall Image Packaging System.\n\n\nThe \npkg\n1\n man page describes the Image Packaging System retrieval client.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npkg\n1\n uses FMRIs\n\n\nEach IPS package is represented by a \nFault Management Resource Identifier\n (FMRI).\nThe pkg\n1\n command uses valid FMRI package information to perform its command actions.\nThe FMRI includes descriptive information about the package, such as the package name, version information, and date.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nFMRI: pkg://openindiana.org/image/editor/gimp@2.8.16-2016.0.0.0:20160702T042138Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScheme \u2013 pkg\n\n\nAuthority \u2013 openindiana.org\n\n\nPackageName \u2013 gimp\n\n\nVersion String \u2013 Consists of three components :\n\n\nBuild Version \u2013 2.8.16\n\n\nBranch Version \u2013 2016.0.0.0\n\n\nTimestamp \u2013 20160702T042138Z\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding help with pkg\n\n\nThe primary source of help for any OpenIndiana command is to review the man page for the command.\nTherefore, be sure to consult the \npkg\n1\n man page for full command information and usage examples.\n\n\nFor example: \nman pkg\n\n\nTo reference command usage directly from the command line, use \npkg help\n.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\npkg help\n\n\nUsage:    pkg [options] command [cmd_options] [operands]\nThe following commands are supported:\n\nPackage Information  : list           search         info      contents\nPackage Transitions  : update         install        uninstall\n                       history        exact-install\nPackage Maintenance  : verify         fix            revert\nPublishers           : publisher      set-publisher  unset-publisher\nPackage Configuration: mediator       set-mediator   unset-mediator\n                       facet          change-facet\n                       variant        change-variant\nImage Constraints    : avoid          unavoid        freeze    unfreeze\nImage Configuration  : refresh        rebuild-index  purge-history\n                       property       set-property   add-property-value\n                       unset-property remove-property-value\nMiscellaneous        : image-create   dehydrate      rehydrate\nFor more info, run: pkg help \ncommand\n\n\n\n\n\nTo retrieve information about a specific command use: \npkg help [command]\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\npkg help update\n\n\nUsage:\n        pkg update [-fnvq] [-C n] [-g path_or_uri ...] [--accept] [--ignore-missing]\n            [--licenses] [--no-be-activate] [--no-index] [--no-refresh]\n            [--no-backup-be | --require-backup-be] [--backup-be-name]\n            [--deny-new-be | --require-new-be] [--be-name name]\n            [-r [-z image_name ... | -Z image_name ...]]\n            [--sync-actuators | --sync-actuators-timeout timeout]\n            [--reject pkg_fmri_pattern ...] [pkg_fmri_pattern ...]\n\n\n\n\nSearching for packages\n\n\nThe \npkg search\n command is used to search locally or remotely for information about packages.\nThe syntax of the command is \npkg search [options] [package]\n.\nIf no search options are specified, the command defaults to performing a search of all the remote repositories defined on the system.\nUsing the \n-l\n option, you may restrict the search to the local system.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\npkg search xchat\n\n\nINDEX                ACTION VALUE                                   PACKAGE\npkg.summary          set    XChat IRC Client                        pkg:/desktop/irc/xchat@2.8.8-2016.0.0.5\npkg.summary          set    HexChat is an IRC client based on XChat pkg:/desktop/irc/hexchat@2.12.1-2016.0.0.1\nbasename             file   usr/bin/xchat                           pkg:/desktop/irc/xchat@2.8.8-2016.0.0.5\ncom.oracle.info.name set    xchat

search results include package names along with additional information.\nTo search for package names only, include the \n-p\n option.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\npkg search -p xchat\n\n\nPACKAGE

search\n command, remember it works much like the Unix \nfind\n command.\nIf you have difficulty finding a package you know should exist, try modifying your search by including wildcards.\n\n\n\nThe \npkg search\n command may also be used to find the package containing a particular file.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\npkg search -l /usr/bin/gpg2\n\n\nINDEX      ACTION VALUE        PACKAGE\npath       file   usr/bin/gpg2 pkg:/crypto/gnupg@2.0.28-2016.0.0.0\n\n\n\n\nListing the status of packages\n\n\nTo list the status of locally installed packages, use the \npkg list [package]\n command.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\npkg list bash\n\n\nNAME (PUBLISHER)                                  VERSION                    IFO\nshell/bash                                        4.3.46-2016.0.0.0

Even if later versions of the package are available in other publishers, those later versions are not installed by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage updates: package originally installed from preferred publisher\n\n\nIf the package was originally installed from the preferred publisher, then the latest available update of the package can be installed from the \ncurrent\n preferred publisher. The package can be install from the \ncurrent\n preferred even if the preferred publisher designation had been moved to another publisher after the package had been originally installed. Even if later versions of the package are available in other publishers, those later versions are not installed by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPackage updates: package originally installed from non-preferred publisher\n\n\nIf the package was originally installed from a non-preferred publisher, then the latest available update of the package is installed from the publisher from which the package was originally installed. Even if later versions of the package are available in other publishers, those later versions are not installed by default.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nListing package history\n\n\nTo list the IPS transactional history, use the \npkg history\n command.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\npkg history\n\n\nSTART                    OPERATION                CLIENT             OUTCOME\n2016-04-21T03:30:04      purge-history

2016-07-09T11:33:05\n\n\n\n\nThe \n-l\n option provides comprehensive details of each transaction\n\n\nThe \n-t\n option allows you to specify a particular transaction\n\n\n\n\nIPS package archives (.p5p)\n\n\nWhen the IPS system was originally conceived there was no standard on-disk format for an IPS package.\nHence, unlike a .rpm file, an SVR4 package, or a .nbm file, it was not possible to transfer IPS packages from system to system.\nThe remote IPS repository where the IPS package resided was the only source for the package.\nThis is because in its native state, the IPS package is not something you can normally download as a single archive file.\n\n\nRecognizing this limitation of IPS, the \n.p5p\n IPS archive format was developed.\nFor IPS archives, files are stored in the pax archive format, along with additional metadata, such as IPS manifest files, and a specific layout of the contents.\n\n\nIPS p5p archives are not like Linux packages where you can install software directly from the package.\nInstead p5p archives are a portable repository format containing a collection of packages.\nThis allows you to create p5p archives for transfer to non-networked systems.\nIPS package archives are also useful for sharing packages for the purpose of testing.\n\n\nIPS archives allow you to:\n\n\n\n\nDownload one or more packages (along with all necessary dependencies) into a p5p archive file.\n\n\nCreate a local repository based on the contents of the p5p archive file.\n\n\nInstall packages from the locally created repository.\n\n\n\n\nCreating the p5p package\n\n\nTo create an IPS archive, the \npkgrecv\n command is used.\n\n\nFor example, to create a \n.p5p\n IPS package archive containing the package \nuserland/web/browser/firefox\n and all of its dependencies from the repository located at \nhttp://example.com:10000\n, use the following command:\n\n\npkgrecv -s http://example.com:10000 -d ~/firefox_test.p5p -a -r pkg://userland/web/browser/firefox@45.3.0-2016.0.0.0:20160817T064143Z\n\n\n\n\nListing the contents of a p5p package\n\n\nThere are at least two different ways to view the contents of an IPS archive.\n\n\npkgrepo -s ~/firefox_test.p5p list\n\n\nPUBLISHER NAME                                          O VERSION\nuserland  library/expat

compatibility, etc.\n\n\nDescribe SFE (SPEC FILES EXTRA) and how it differs from OI and other repos.\n\n\nHow to add additional repos, etc.\n\n\nHow to compile your own software.\n\n\nI think there is an existing wiki page for this.\n\n\nGiven the limited number of IPS packages currently available, this is a pretty important subject to write about.\n\n\nAlso could look here (might be outdated):\n\n\nweb link\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to IPS and SVR4 package management tools, it is also possible to use \npkgsrc\n.\n\n\nFor more information about pkgsrc, see the \nJoyent package source website\n.\n\n\n \nCAUTION:\n\n\n\n\nThe use of 3rd party repositories and package managers increases the likelihood of conflicts between package versions and their dependencies.\nFurthermore, the OpenIndiana project cannot guarantee the qualify of packages obtained from 3rd party repositories.\nTherefore, use 3rd party repositories and 3rd party package tools at your own risk.\n\n\n\n\n\nManaging boot environments\n\n\nA boot environment is a bootable instance of an OpenIndiana operating system image plus any other application software packages installed into that image.\nYou can maintain multiple boot environments on your system, and each boot environment could have different software versions installed.\nUpon the initial installation of OpenIndiana onto your system, a boot environment is created.\nUse the \nbeadm\n1M\n utility to administer additional boot environments on your system.\n\n\nThe \nbeadmn\n utility is designed to work in concert with the ZFS file system and the IPS package manager.\n\n\nWhy use multiple boot environments?\n\n\nWith multiple boot environments, the process of updating software becomes a low risk operation because you can create backup boot environments before making any software updates to your system.\nIf needed, you have the option of booting a backup boot environment.\n\n\nHere are some specific examples where having more than one OpenIndiana boot environment, and managing them with the \nbeadm\n utility, is useful:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen you use the \npkg update\n command to update all the packages in your active OpenIndiana boot environment, this process automatically creates a clone of that boot environment.\nThe packages are updated in the clone rather than in the original boot environment.\nAfter successfully completing the updates, the new clone is activated.\nThen, the clone will become the new default boot environment on the next reboot.\nThe original boot environment remains on the GRUB menu as an alternate selection.\nYou can use the \nbeadm list\n command to see a list of all the boot environments on the system, including the backup boot environment that still has its original, unchanged software.\nIf you are not satisfied with the updates made to the environment, you can use the \nbeadm activate\n command to specify that the backup will become the default boot environment on the next reboot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you are modifying a boot environment, you can take a snapshot of that environment at any stage during modifications by using the \nbeadm create\n command.\nA snapshot is a read-only image of a dataset or boot environment at a given point in time.\nYou can create custom names for each snapshot that identify when or why the snapshot was created.\nFor example, if you are doing monthly upgrades to your boot environment, you can capture snapshots for each monthly upgrade.\nYou can use the \nbeadm list -s\n command to view the available snapshots for a boot environment.\nA snapshot is not bootable.\nBut, you can create a boot environment, based on that snapshot, by using the \n-e\n option for the \nbeadm create\n command.\nThen you can use the \nbeadm activate\n command to specify that this boot environment will become the default boot environment on the next reboot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can maintain more than one boot environment on your system, and perform various upgrades on each of them as needed.\nFor example, you can clone a boot environment by using the \nbeadm create\n command.\nA clone is a bootable copy of a boot environment.\nThen, you can install, test, and update different software packages on the original boot environment and on its clone.\nAlthough only one boot environment can be active at a time, you can mount an inactive boot environment by using the \nbeadm mount\n command.\nThen you can use the \npkg update\n command with the \n-R\n option to update all the packages in that inactive, mounted environment.\nOr, use the \npkg install packagename\n with the \n-R\n option to update specific packages on that environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFeatures of the beadm utility\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility has the following features:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility aggregates all datasets in a boot environment and performs actions on the entire boot environment at once.\nYou no longer need to perform ZFS commands to modify each dataset individually.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility manages the dataset structures within boot environments.\nFor example, when the \nbeadm\n utility clones a boot environment that has shared datasets, the utility automatically recognizes and manages those shared datasets for the new boot environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility enables you to perform administrative tasks on your boot environments.\nThese tasks can be performed without upgrading your system.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility automatically manages and updates the GRUB menu.\nFor example, when you use the \nbeadm\n utility to create a new boot environment, that environment is automatically added to the GRUB menu.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility enables you to perform the following tasks:\n\n\n\n\nCreate a new boot environment based on the active boot environment\n\n\nCreate a new boot environment based on an inactive boot environment\n\n\nCreate a snapshot of an existing boot environment\n\n\nCreate a new boot environment based on an existing snapshot\n\n\nCreate a new boot environment and add a custom title to the GRUB menu.\n\n\nActivate an existing, inactive boot environment\n\n\nMount a boot environment\n\n\nUnmount a boot environment\n\n\nDestroy a boot environment\n\n\nDestroy a snapshot of a boot environment\n\n\nRename an existing, inactive boot environment\n\n\nDisplay information about your boot environment snapshots and datasets\n\n\n\n\nbeadm command reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm\n\n\nDisplays command usage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm activate \nBE\n\n\nMakes the specified boot environment the active boot environment upon the next reboot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm create \nBE\n\n\nCreates a new boot environment with the name specified. Unless the \n-e\n option is provided, the new boot environment is created as a clone of the currently running boot environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm create \nBE@snapshot\n\n\nCreates a snapshot of the existing boot environment with the specified snapshot name.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm destroy \nBE\n\n\nDestroys the boot environment named BE or destroys an existing snapshot, BE@snapshot, of a boot environment. Prompts for confirmation before destroying the boot environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm list \nBE\n\n\nLists information about the specified boot environment, or lists information for all boot environments if a boot environment name is not provided. The default is to list boot environments without any additional information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm mount \nBE\n \nmountpoint\n\n\nMounts the specified boot environment at the specified mount point. The mount point must be an already existing, empty directory.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm rename \nold BE\n \nnew BE\n\n\nRenames the specified boot environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm unmount [-f] \nBE\n\n\nUnmounts the specified boot environment. \n-f\n \u2013 Forcefully unmounts the boot environment even if it is currently busy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor detailed instructions about the \nbeadm\n utility, see the \nbeadm\n1M\n man page.\n\n\nbeadm zones support\n\n\nZones partitioning technology is used to virtualize operating system services and provide an isolated and secure environment for running applications.\nEach OpenIndiana system is a global zone.\nWithin a global zone, specific non-global zones can be created.\n\n\nZones support limitations\n\n\nNote the following limitations of support for non-global zones in the beadm utility and in related processes:\n\n\n\n\nWhen using the \npkg update\n command, the \n-r\n switch is required to upgrade all zones.\n\n\nThe \nbeadm\n utility is not supported inside a non-global zone.\n\n\nNon-global zone support is limited to ZFS support.\nZones are not supported unless they are on ZFS.\n\n\nZones are not supported in the rpool/ROOT namespace.\nNon-global zones are cloned or copied only when the original zone is within the shared area for the global zone, for example, within rpool/export or within rpool/zones.\n\n\nAlthough the \nbeadm\n utility affects the non-global zones on your system, the \nbeadm\n utility does not display zones information.\nUse the \nzoneadm\n utility to view changes in the zones in your boot environment.\nFor example, use the \nzoneadm\n list command to view a list of all current zones on the system.\n\n\n\n\nFor further information, see the \nzoneadm\n1M\n man page.\n\n\nZones support specifications\n\n\nThe beadm command impacts the non-global zones in your boot environments as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommand\n\n\nSupport Details\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm create\n\n\nWhen you clone a boot environment by using the beadm create command, all zones in that boot environment are copied into the new boot environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm destroy\n\n\nWhen you destroy an inactive boot environment, the zones that belong to that boot environment are also destroyed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm mount\n\n\nWhen you mount a boot environment, the zones in that environment are mounted relative to the mount points for the environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm unmount\n\n\nWhen you unmount a boot environment, the zones in that environment are also unmounted. All mount points are returned to their states prior to being mounted.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nbeadm rename\n\n\nWhen you rename a boot environment, that change does not impact the names of the zones or the names of the datasets that are used for those zones in that boot environment. The change does not impact the relationships between the zones and their related boot environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe X-Window system\n\n\n \nDOC TEAM NOTE:\n\n\n\nWrite about:\n\n\n\n\nHow to create and use an xorg.conf file.\n\n\nGraphics drivers are found in the \n/usr/lib/xorg/modules/drivers/amd64/\n graphics driver directory\n\n\nmodinfo only shows kernel drivers, not Xorg drivers, since Xorg drivers are just driver.so files dlopen'ed by a userspace process, not loaded into the kernel address space.\n\n\nTo see what drivers Xorg loaded, either check \n/var/log/Xorg.0.log\n or run \npldd\n on the Xorg process.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVideo card support (2D)\n\n\n\n\nNearly all cards can use the VESA driver, and are therefore supported for 2D.\n\n\n2D acceleration for NVidia GPU's is provided by the Nvidia binary driver.\n\n\nAn effort is underway to further improve Radeon (2D) acceleration for both legacy and modern AMD GPU's.\n\n\n\n\nVideo card support (3D)\n\n\n\n\nNearly all NVidia GPU's are supported by the Nvidia binary driver.\n\n\nBeginning with the July 2016 experimental release, most Intel GPU's are now also supported.\n\n\nNo 3D support is currently available for AMD GPU's.\n\n\n\n\n \nDOC TEAM NOTE:\n\n\n\nWrite about:\n\n\n\n\nThe expected behavior when booting the live CD from a system with an NVIDIA card.\n\n\nDiscuss procedure for adding an NVIDIA card to a system that was using VESA or some other non-3d video driver.\n\n\nTroubleshooting - what logs to look at, manual configuration, etc.\n\n\nWalk through NVIDIA utility screens.\n\n\n\n\n\nDevice drivers\n\n\n \nDOC TEAM NOTE:\n\n\n\nWrite about:\n\n\n\n\nFinding hardware id's\n\n\nSearching for drivers\n\n\nInstalling and loading drivers\n\n\nUsing the \nmodinfo\n command to list information about loaded kernel driver modules\n\n\nUsing \nmodload\n to load kernel driver modules\n\n\nUsing \nmodunload\n to unload kernel driver modules\n\n\nUsing the \nadd_drv\n command\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdding device ID's to \n/etc/driver_aliases\n, and \n/etc/driver_classes\n, etc.",

Browse to the following Wiki page:  https://wiki.openindiana.org/oi/Release+Notes .    The top portion of the disk selection and partitioning screen shows all the disks found on the system, including removable disks.\nEach disk is represented with a disk icon.\nBelow each disk icon the installer displays the size of each disk in Gigabytes (GB) and the disk type (IDE, ATA, etc.).\nWithin this upper panel, select the disk where you wish to install OpenIndiana.\nThe lower portion of this screen displays partitioning options.  Within the lower panel, select one of the following options:     Option  Description      Use the whole disk  When the  Use the whole disk  option is selected, the entire disk is used for the installation. For the selected disk, all existing partitions and any data which they may contain, will be overwritten with the OpenIndiana operating system.    Partition the disk  When the  Partition the disk  option is selected, the bottom portion of this panel displays the disk partitioning layout. Prior to selecting this option, please be sure to review all the informational notes and warnings concerning the use of the partitioning option.     \nIf you choose to partition the disk, you have additional options as shown above.\nPlease take some time to read the additional guidance provided below.\nWhen you have revised the partitioning as needed, click the  Next  button to continue.    NOTE:  \nRegardless of the partitioning option chosen for the installation, manual control of the OpenIndiana file system layout is not supported.\nDuring the installation, the Solaris fdisk partition is reformatted with a default ZFS file system layout.\nAll existing file systems on the Solaris partition are destroyed.\nThe installation uses a Solaris fdisk partition to create a ZFS storage pool.    NOTE:  \nIf you choose to partition the disk, review the following partitioning guidelines, then revise the partitioning panel settings as needed.   Only one Solaris partition is allowed.\nIf an existing Solaris partition is available, that Solaris partition will be the target for the installation.\nOr, if you do not have an existing Solaris partition, you can change any existing partition to a Solaris partition.  You can resize existing partitions, delete partitions, and create new partitions in this panel.\nFor this option, one existing Solaris partition must be available as the target for the installation.  If you used a third-party partitioning tool such as GParted, then the Disk panel displays a partition named Linux-swap on which you can install OpenIndiana.  In this panel, use the drop-down list for the Linux-swap partition name to change the partition name to Solaris.       CAUTION:  \nIf the existing partition table cannot be read, a warning is displayed, and the panel displays proposed partitioning.\nIn this case, all data on the selected disk is destroyed.  If the table can be read, then the following information applies:   The partitions are displayed in physically sequential order as they are laid out on the disk.  Resizing a Solaris partition destroys the data on that partition and all physically subsequent partitions.  Existing data is not moved to conform to a new partition layout.  However, resizing the last partition or appending a new partition does not affect the data that already exists in other partitions.    Non-Solaris partitions cannot be resized.  To make additional space available, you can change an existing partition to Unused.  However, if you change an existing partition to Unused, all subsequent non-Solaris partitions are also changed to Unused.    New partitions can only use the available space that follows the last defined partition.  The installer cannot utilize unallocated chunks of space between existing defined partitions.  Use the fdisk(1M) command to create new partitions that use the free space between exiting partitions.    This screen enables you to type the correct time zone, date, and time for the system to be installed.\nThe top half of the panel displays a world map with major cities marked.\nThe bottom half of the panel provides drop-down selections.\nYou can choose the time zone either from the map or from the drop-down list.   If you select the time zone from the map, click on a city or click anywhere on the map.   If you click on the map, but not on a city, the map automatically magnifies that area.\nYou can click on a location within that magnified area.\nYou can drag the cursor to move the magnified area to a different location on the map.\nWhen you select a site on the map, the drop-down selections automatically populate with the time zone, date, and current time for that map selection.\nYou can right-click to undo magnification.   Instead of using the map, you can make your selections in the drop-down fields.   Select your region, then select Location. Finally, select time zone.\nThe options for each drop-down field are determined by the selection made in the prior drop-down field.    NOTE:  \nAfter making your selections, you may also edit the default date and time that is provided.  When the settings are correct, click Next to continue.   This screen enables you to select a language and locale.\nThese selections determine the language support, the default date and time, and other data formats for the installed system.    You can accept the default language selection or change the selection.    A language selection is required.\nYou can select \u201cno default language support.\u201d    The language chosen automatically determines the available locales in the drop-down list.\nOnly one locale can be selected.      NOTE:  \nAny time that you log in to the installed system, you can change either the locale for that particular session or the default locale by using the Options button in the Login dialog box.   Review the following guidelines:   Root login is not enabled either on the Live CD or on the installed system.\nYou must log in as the user that you create in this panel.\nAfter you log in, you can then become root to configure the system.     NOTE:  \nIf you do not create a user account in this panel, root is set up as a normal account on the installed system, instead of as a role.\nThis is the only situation where you can log in to the installed system as root.    Both the root password and user account are optional.\nHowever, for better security, do complete these fields.\nIf the root password is not defined, a reminder is displayed when you click Next.\nIf you do not want to define a root password, you can proceed.    A user account requires only a Login name for the account to be valid.\nFor better security, however, do complete all fields.\nIf the user account information is not valid, a reminder is displayed when you click Next.\nIf you do not want to define a user account, you can proceed.    Type a computer name or accept the default.\nThe computer name field cannot be blank.     This screen summarizes the configuration options which will be used to perform the installation.\nBe sure to take the time to review this summary.\nIf a configuration option needs to be changed, you may do so by clicking the  Back  button.\nIf the installation options are acceptable, click the  Install  button to begin the installation.    CAUTION:  \nOnce you have clicked the  Install  button, the option to  Quit  the installation is no longer available.\nDo not attempt to interrupt an installation already in progress or the system will be left in an inconsistent state.   During the installation, a progress bar is displayed.\nThe time required to complete the installation is dependent on your hardware.   The final screen displays completion messages.\nFrom within this panel you may review the installation log.\nTo view the installation log, click the link titled  OpenIndiana Installation Log .\nThe installation log will open in a new window.   Using the slider located on the right side of the log viewer window, you may scroll up and down to view the entire log file.\nAfter reviewing the log, you may exit the log viewer by clicking the  Close  button.

Recognizing this limitation of IPS, the  .p5p  IPS archive format was developed.\nFor IPS archives, files are stored in the pax archive format, along with additional metadata, such as IPS manifest files, and a specific layout of the contents.  IPS p5p archives are not like Linux packages where you can install software directly from the package.\nInstead p5p archives are a portable repository format containing a collection of packages.\nThis allows you to create p5p archives for transfer to non-networked systems.\nIPS package archives are also useful for sharing packages for the purpose of testing.  IPS archives allow you to:   Download one or more packages (along with all necessary dependencies) into a p5p archive file.  Create a local repository based on the contents of the p5p archive file.

Here are some specific examples where having more than one OpenIndiana boot environment, and managing them with the  beadm  utility, is useful:    When you use the  pkg update  command to update all the packages in your active OpenIndiana boot environment, this process automatically creates a clone of that boot environment.\nThe packages are updated in the clone rather than in the original boot environment.\nAfter successfully completing the updates, the new clone is activated.\nThen, the clone will become the new default boot environment on the next reboot.\nThe original boot environment remains on the GRUB menu as an alternate selection.\nYou can use the  beadm list  command to see a list of all the boot environments on the system, including the backup boot environment that still has its original, unchanged software.\nIf you are not satisfied with the updates made to the environment, you can use the  beadm activate  command to specify that the backup will become the default boot environment on the next reboot.    If you are modifying a boot environment, you can take a snapshot of that environment at any stage during modifications by using the  beadm create  command.\nA snapshot is a read-only image of a dataset or boot environment at a given point in time.\nYou can create custom names for each snapshot that identify when or why the snapshot was created.\nFor example, if you are doing monthly upgrades to your boot environment, you can capture snapshots for each monthly upgrade.\nYou can use the  beadm list -s  command to view the available snapshots for a boot environment.\nA snapshot is not bootable.\nBut, you can create a boot environment, based on that snapshot, by using the  -e  option for the  beadm create  command.\nThen you can use the  beadm activate  command to specify that this boot environment will become the default boot environment on the next reboot.    You can maintain more than one boot environment on your system, and perform various upgrades on each of them as needed.\nFor example, you can clone a boot environment by using the  beadm create  command.\nA clone is a bootable copy of a boot environment.\nThen, you can install, test, and update different software packages on the original boot environment and on its clone.\nAlthough only one boot environment can be active at a time, you can mount an inactive boot environment by using the  beadm mount  command.\nThen you can use the  pkg update  command with the  -R  option to update all the packages in that inactive, mounted environment.\nOr, use the  pkg install packagename  with the  -R  option to update specific packages on that environment.",

This change was implemented in preparation for the OpenSolaris 2010.03 release.\nThe proposed release notes for OpenSolaris 2010.03 included this statement: \"CUPS support includes a web and graphical interface to manage your printing environment. A system that is running CUPS becomes a host that can accept print requests from client systems, process those requests, and then send them to the appropriate printer. To facilitate CUPS support, a new print-service command has been introduced that provides a mechanism for switching between CUPS print service and the LP print service, including 2 new SMF services.\"\nDoc Team Notes:\n Oracle Solaris dropped support for lp when they introduced CUPS in the Solaris 11.0 release. The OpenIndiana project retained both print subsystems, which are managed by the \nprint-service\n command. Both \nlp\n and \nlpr\n are symbolically linked to \nprint-service\n. Issuing the command \nprint-service -q\n shows the active print subsystem, which by default is CUPS.

Deprecation notes:  Subsequent to the release of OpenSolaris 2009.06, the Common UNIX Printing System (CUPS) was selected as the default print service, however, the lp print service was retained. This change was implemented in preparation for the OpenSolaris 2010.03 release. The proposed release notes for OpenSolaris 2010.03 included this statement: \"CUPS support includes a web and graphical interface to manage your printing environment. A system that is running CUPS becomes a host that can accept print requests from client systems, process those requests, and then send them to the appropriate printer. To facilitate CUPS support, a new print-service command has been introduced that provides a mechanism for switching between CUPS print service and the LP print service, including 2 new SMF services.\" Doc Team Notes:  Oracle Solaris dropped support for lp when they introduced CUPS in the Solaris 11.0 release. The OpenIndiana project retained both print subsystems, which are managed by the  print-service  command. Both  lp  and  lpr  are symbolically linked to  print-service . Issuing the command  print-service -q  shows the active print subsystem, which by default is CUPS. More information can be found in the print-service (1M) man page.

DTrace provides a powerful infrastructure to permit administrators, developers, and service personnel to concisely answer arbitrary questions about the behavior of the operating system and user programs.\nThe Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide describes how to use DTrace to observe, debug, and tune system behavior. This book also includes a complete reference for bundled DTrace observability tools and the \nD\n programming language.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelevancy to OpenIndiana Hipster\n\n\nTo be determined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\n\n\nIf you have ever wanted to understand the behavior of your system, DTrace is the tool for you. DTrace is a comprehensive dynamic tracing facility that is built into Solaris. The DTrace facility can be used to examine the behavior of user programs. The DTrace facility can also be used to examine the behavior of the operating system.\nDTrace can be used by system administrators or application developers, and is suitable for use with live production systems. DTrace will allow you to explore your system to understand how it works, track down performance problems across many layers of software, or locate the cause of aberrant behavior. \nAs you'll see, DTrace lets you create your own custom programs to dynamically instrument the system and provide immediate, concise answers to arbitrary questions you can formulate using the DTrace \nD\n programming language. \nDTrace allows all Solaris users to:\nDynamically enable and manage thousands of probes\nDynamically associate logical predicates and actions with probes\nDynamically manage trace buffers and buffer policies\nDisplay and examine trace data from the live system or a crash dump\nDTrace allows Solaris developers and administrators to:\nImplement custom scripts that use the DTrace facility\nImplement layered tools that use DTrace to retrieve trace data\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nBasic familiarity with a programming language such as \nC\n or a scripting language such as \nawk(1)\n or \nperl(1)\n will help you learn DTrace and the \nD\n programming language faster, but you need not be an expert in any of these areas.

The Solaris Modular Debugger Guide describes how to use MDB to debug complex software systems, with a particular emphasis on the facilities available for debugging the Solaris kernel and associated device drivers and modules. It also includes a complete reference for and discussion of the MDB language syntax, debugger features, and MDB Module Programming API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRelevancy to OpenIndiana Hipster\n\n\nTo be determined\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTarget Audience\n\n\nIf you were a detective and were investigating at the scene of a crime, you might interview the witnesses and ask them to describe what happened and who they saw. However, if there were no witnesses or these descriptions proved insufficient, you might consider collecting fingerprints and forensic evidence that could be examined for DNA to help solve the case.\nOften, software program failures divide into analogous categories: problems that can be solved with source-level debugging tools, and problems that require low-level debugging facilities, examination of core files, and knowledge of assembly language to diagnose and correct.\nMDB facilitates analysis of this second class of problems.\nMDB is most useful when you are programming a complex low-level software system such as an operating system. The MDB debugging framework allows you to construct your own custom analysis tools to aid in the diagnosis of these low-level problems. MDB also provides a powerful set of built-in commands that enable you to analyze the state of your program at the assembly language level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nFamiliarity with assembly language programming and debugging\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nUpdated by the illumos project, this title is available in a more recent version:\n\nModular Debugger Guide\n\n\n\n\nDevice Driver Tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nItem\n\n\nDetails\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDocument Link\n\n\nDevice Driver Tutorial\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTopics\n\n\nThis Device Driver Tutorial is a hands-on guide that shows you how to develop a simple device driver for the Solaris\u2122 Operating System (Solaris OS).

You also should read this book if you need to maintain existing drivers or add new functionality to existing Solaris OS drivers. Information about the kernel provided in this book also will help you troubleshoot any problems you might encounter installing or configuring Solaris systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRequirements\n\n\nTo write device drivers for the Solaris OS, you should have the following background:\nBe a confident C programmer\nHave experience with data structures, especially with linked lists\nUnderstand bit operations\nUnderstand indirect function calls\nUnderstand caching\nUnderstand multi-threading (see the Multi-threaded Programming Guide)\nBe familiar with a UNIX\u00ae shell\nUnderstand the basics of UNIX system and I/O architecture\nThe most important information you need to have to write a device driver are the characteristics of the device. Get a detailed specification for the device you want to drive.\nExperience with Solaris OS compilers, debuggers, and other tools will be very helpful to you. You also need to understand where the file system fits with the kernel and the application layer.

DTrace provides a powerful infrastructure to permit administrators, developers, and service personnel to concisely answer arbitrary questions about the behavior of the operating system and user programs. The Solaris Dynamic Tracing Guide describes how to use DTrace to observe, debug, and tune system behavior. This book also includes a complete reference for bundled DTrace observability tools and the  D  programming language.    Relevancy to OpenIndiana Hipster  To be determined    Target Audience  If you have ever wanted to understand the behavior of your system, DTrace is the tool for you. DTrace is a comprehensive dynamic tracing facility that is built into Solaris. The DTrace facility can be used to examine the behavior of user programs. The DTrace facility can also be used to examine the behavior of the operating system. DTrace can be used by system administrators or application developers, and is suitable for use with live production systems. DTrace will allow you to explore your system to understand how it works, track down performance problems across many layers of software, or locate the cause of aberrant behavior.  As you'll see, DTrace lets you create your own custom programs to dynamically instrument the system and provide immediate, concise answers to arbitrary questions you can formulate using the DTrace  D  programming language.  DTrace allows all Solaris users to: Dynamically enable and manage thousands of probes Dynamically associate logical predicates and actions with probes Dynamically manage trace buffers and buffer policies Display and examine trace data from the live system or a crash dump DTrace allows Solaris developers and administrators to: Implement custom scripts that use the DTrace facility Implement layered tools that use DTrace to retrieve trace data    Requirements  Basic familiarity with a programming language such as  C  or a scripting language such as  awk(1)  or  perl(1)  will help you learn DTrace and the  D  programming language faster, but you need not be an expert in any of these areas. If you have never written a program or script before in any language, Related Information provides references to other documents you might find useful.

The Solaris Modular Debugger Guide describes how to use MDB to debug complex software systems, with a particular emphasis on the facilities available for debugging the Solaris kernel and associated device drivers and modules. It also includes a complete reference for and discussion of the MDB language syntax, debugger features, and MDB Module Programming API.    Relevancy to OpenIndiana Hipster  To be determined    Target Audience  If you were a detective and were investigating at the scene of a crime, you might interview the witnesses and ask them to describe what happened and who they saw. However, if there were no witnesses or these descriptions proved insufficient, you might consider collecting fingerprints and forensic evidence that could be examined for DNA to help solve the case. Often, software program failures divide into analogous categories: problems that can be solved with source-level debugging tools, and problems that require low-level debugging facilities, examination of core files, and knowledge of assembly language to diagnose and correct. MDB facilitates analysis of this second class of problems. MDB is most useful when you are programming a complex low-level software system such as an operating system. The MDB debugging framework allows you to construct your own custom analysis tools to aid in the diagnosis of these low-level problems. MDB also provides a powerful set of built-in commands that enable you to analyze the state of your program at the assembly language level.

Device Driver Tutorial also explains how device drivers work in the Solaris OS. This book is a companion to  Writing Device Drivers . Writing Device Drivers  is a thorough reference document that discusses many types of devices and drivers. Device Driver Tutorial examines complete drivers but does not provide a comprehensive treatment of all driver types. Device Driver Tutorial often points to Writing Device Drivers and other content for further information.    Relevancy to OpenIndiana Hipster  To be determined    Target Audience  You should read this tutorial if you need to develop, install, and configure device drivers for the Solaris OS. You also should read this book if you need to maintain existing drivers or add new functionality to existing Solaris OS drivers. Information about the kernel provided in this book also will help you troubleshoot any problems you might encounter installing or configuring Solaris systems.    Requirements  To write device drivers for the Solaris OS, you should have the following background: Be a confident C programmer Have experience with data structures, especially with linked lists Understand bit operations Understand indirect function calls Understand caching Understand multi-threading (see the Multi-threaded Programming Guide) Be familiar with a UNIX\u00ae shell Understand the basics of UNIX system and I/O architecture The most important information you need to have to write a device driver are the characteristics of the device. Get a detailed specification for the device you want to drive. Experience with Solaris OS compilers, debuggers, and other tools will be very helpful to you. You also need to understand where the file system fits with the kernel and the application layer. These topics are discussed in this tutorial.",

(optional)\n\n\n\n\nhttps://github.com/plasticboy/vim-markdown/\n\n\n\n\nFork the OpenIndiana Docs repository\n\n\n\n\nOpen your web browser to the \nOpenIndiana Docs GitHub Repository\n.\n\n\nClick the \nFork\n button found in the upper right hand corner of the page.\n\n\nForking creates a server side clone of the upstream repository.\n\n\nThis clone is your own personal copy of the OpenIndiana Docs repository.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreate a local clone of your fork\n\n\ngit clone https://github.com/YOUR-USER-NAME/oi-docs.git\n\n\n\n\nThe local clone is where you will perform your work.\nThink of your local clone as your working copy of the repository.\nThe local clone is also where you will commit your changes.\nPeriodically you will push these local changes to your fork residing on Github.\n\n\nAdd the upstream repository\n\n\ncd oi-docs\ngit remote add upstream https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-docs.git\n\n\n\n\nVerify things with \ngit remote -v\n\n\nYou should now see:\n\n\norigin  https://github.com/YOUR-USER-NAME/oi-docs.git (fetch)\norigin  https://github.com/YOUR-USER-NAME/oi-docs.git (push)\nupstream        https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-docs.git (fetch)\nupstream        https://github.com/OpenIndiana/oi-docs.git (push)\n\n\n\n\nSync and merge changes from the upstream repository\n\n\nPeriodically you will want to \nrebase\n your local copy by bringing in changes from the upstream repository.\nIn plain English, this means the upstream repository is added so you can periodically \npull down\n changes from the upstream master repository and merge them into your local clone.\nThis way your local clone remains in synchronization with the master upstream repository.\nIt is always a good idea to perform a pull from the upstream master repository prior to making changes to your local clone (working copy).\n\n\ngit pull upstream master\n\n\n\n\nOpenIndiana Docs site structure (master branch)\n\n\nAll site development occurs within

offer it as a plugin).\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nMajor changes should be performed within a separate branch, appropriately named to reflect the changes being made.\n\n\n\nFor a list of subject to write about:\n\n\n\n\nSee the site TODO list.\n\n\nHave a look at the site Github issues list.\n\n\nSee the \nTopics\n page for a list of suggestions and TODO's.\n\n\nWrite a new tutorial, or complete a small section of the handbook, etc.\n\n\nConsult with other doc team contributors for even more ideas.\n\n\n\n\nAdding new pages to the site menu\n\n\nSite configuration settings and menus are located in \nmkdocs.yml\n.\nTo add a page to the menu, simply add a line to this file.\nSee the code snippet below for examples.\n\n\n- Docs:\n        - 'OpenIndiana Code of Conduct': misc/conduct.md\n        - 'OpenIndiana FAQ': misc/faq.md\n        - 'OpenIndiana Handbook': handbook/handbook.md\n        - OpenSolaris Books:\n                - 'Book Index': books/index.md\n                - 'Basic

Extensions Administration': books/trusted.md\n                - 'Development Titles': books/develop.md\n\n\n\n\nVisualize your changes using live preview\n\n\nTo assist with the content authoring process, it may be helpful to visualize your changes using a live preview.\n\n\n\n\nFrom the root of the \noi-docs/\n directory:\n\n\nType: \nmkdocs serve\n and press enter.\n\n\nOpen your web browser to 127.0.0.1:8000.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEach time you save your changes, the site page is automatically reloaded within your web browser.\n\n\nTo shut down the live preview web server, use \nCTRL\n + \nC\n.\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nIf you wish to preview your changes on a remotely networked system or on a networked mobile device such as a tablet, the site can also be served on your LAN IP address.\n\n\nTo do so, issue the following command: \nmkdocs serve --dev-addr=0.0.0.0:8000\n\n\n\n\nRunning Markdown Lint (locally)\n\n\nMarkdown Lint is used to check your changes for Markdown syntax errors.\nPrior to submitting a pull request (PR), please consider running Markdown Lint locally on your computer.\n\n\nFrom the root of the \noi-docs/\n directory, execute the following command:\n\n\nmdl -s markdownlint-rules.rb .\n\n\n\n\nMarkdown Lint will automatically traverse the entire folder structure looking for problems.\nAlternately you may also run \nmdl\n on a specific file.\nSimply replace the period (.) with the path to the file.\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\n\nBefore you can run \nmdl\n, it may be necessary to add the path to your \n$PATH\n variable.\n\n\nFor example:\n\n\nOn OpenIndiana, markdown lint (mdl) resides in \n/usr/ruby/1.9/bin/\n which is not normally part of the search path.\nTo run this command without having to specify the complete path each time, add the following to your \n.bashrc\n\n\nPATH=$PATH:/usr/ruby/1.9/bin/\nexport PATH\n\n\n\n\nTo immediately effect this change, source your \n.bashrc\n as follows:\n\n\nsource ~/.bashrc\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEnabling spell checking in vim\n\n\nYou can invoke spell checking in your current session by inputting the command:\n\n\n:set spell spelllang=en_us\n\n\nIf you would like a more permanent solution, enable spell checking in your \n.vimrc\n by adding the line:\n\n\nset spelllang=en_us\n\n\nMisspelled words will now be highlighted (color varies dependent on your .Xresources file)\n\n\nKeyboard shortcuts for spell checking in vim\n\n\n\n\n]s\n to find the previously misspelled word.\n\n\n[s\n to find the next misspelled word.\n\n\nWith the cursor at the beginning of a word, use \nz=\n to bring up a list of suggested replacements.\n\n\nzg\n will add a word to the local dictionary exception file.\n\n\nzw\n is used to mark a word as incorrect.\n\n\n\n\nCommit and push your changes.\n\n\ngit status\ngit add some-file-you-just-edited\ngit commit -m 'your commit message'\ngit push\n\n\n\n\nWhen you make a commit, you are committing those changes your local clone.\nWhen you perform a push, your are pushing your commits from your local clone to your fork residing on Github.\n\n\nSend a pull request.\n\n\n\n\nOpen your web browser to \nyour forked copy\n of the OpenIndiana Docs repository.\n\n\n\n\nFor example: \nhttps://github.com/your-user-name/oi-docs\n\n\n\n\nClick the button for \nNew pull request\n.\n\n\nAdd some notes about your change.\n\n\nSubmit your PR (pull request).\n\n\n\n\nPull requests are used to request a \npull in\n of changes from your fork to the master repository.\n\n\n \nNOTE:\n\n\n\nAfter a pull request has been submitted, and for the duration of time your pull request remains open and uncommitted to the OI-DOCS master repository, any additional commits you make to your own fork of the oi-docs repository will automatically be included in your open pull request.\n\n\n\nWhat happens next?\n\n\nAt this point a member of the OpenIndiana Project docs team will review your changes.\nIf no corrections are required, your changes will be accepted and merged into the upstream repository.\n\n\nUpon commit, publishing occurs automatically using Travis-CI.",

Doc team Note: The guidance provided by the OSOL printing administration book is largely obsolete (but parts may still be valid) as CUPS replaced the old Solaris printing subsystem found in OpenSolaris 2009.06.\nHowever, OpenIndiana has 2 print subsystems (CUPS and LP).\nThey are managed by the  print-service  command, which allows you to designate the active print subsystem.\nSee the print-services (1M) man page for more information.\nIn contrast, Oracle dropped lp completely in the Solaris 11.0 release.",
